# DataCamp_SQL

Used to store the jupyter note books from the project sections in Datacamp for the various guided/ unguided projects that i have completed as part of my practice for SQL.  

## Analyzing Unicorn Companies 
[Project 1] from datacamp was to analyse data on a number of companies brief below.
Using a PostgreSQL database you’ll be able to analyze information about unicorn companies worth over $1 billion! You’ll find out which industries have the highest average valuation and then zoom in on these to determine how many new unicorns have been produced annually between 2019 and 2021! **My finished [answer](https://github.com/Asomand/DataCamp_SQL/blob/1522975cda98070aba572bc0afa3aedc1db22dfe/Unicorns/notebook.ipynb)** 

## Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales 
[Project 2] Brief is below for this project sales data for a motorcyle company.
Working on behalf of a company that sells motorcycle parts, you'll dig into their data to help them understand their revenue streams. You'll build up a query to find out how much net revenue they are generating across their product lines, segregating by date and warehouse. **My finished [answer](https://github.com/Asomand/DataCamp_SQL/blob/4ab0873d08a9a79ec78377316e404590207e7ddb/Motorcyle/notebook.ipynb)**

## Analyzing Industry Carbon Emissions
[Project 3] Brief below analyse a data set to find which industry pollutes the most.
Product emissions make up more than 75% of global emissions. But which industries are the worst offenders?
Use this dataset alongside your Intermediate SQL skills to find out! **My finsihed [answer](https://github.com/Asomand/DataCamp_SQL/blob/d43f73d43fc77eec4b43ddd318cabdfc45e97547/Carbon%20Emissions/notebook%20(1).ipynb)**

## Analyzing American Baby Name Trends
[Project 4] Make use of dataset of baby names to spot and identify trends.
What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, you'll use data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes. **My finished [answer](https://github.com/Asomand/DataCamp_SQL/blob/d43f73d43fc77eec4b43ddd318cabdfc45e97547/Baby%20Names/notebook.ipynb)**
